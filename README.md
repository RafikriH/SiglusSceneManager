### SiglusSceneManager ~1.9
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ForumHulp/pageaddon.svg?branch=master)](http://vnx.uvnworks.com)

A DLL Library tool to allow you write your own string editor of the SiglusEngine Scripts in C#
Tested with: Hanasaki Work Spring!, Rewrite+
If You like, give-me a star plz~~


#### Detection of the key of Siglus automatic
I Write a function to recognize the algorithm that loads on the memory the password of the engine, tried in 2 games, both recent, they worked. 
SiglusEngine has a dynamic algorithym, feel lucky if it recognize your game's algorithym. For now, 2 kinds are supported

#### SiglusPatcher
I Write this to enable the Debug Mode to a game without need reanalyze the engine again, 
And consequently I ended up creating a patch for wordwrap (this is not the real intention, so no warranties. Run with -WordWrap paramter if is what you want.)

PS: If your team have a hacker who can enable the WordWrap by heself, i don't recommend my tool

Notes:

-Tested with Rewrite+, Chihaya Rolling v1.10
