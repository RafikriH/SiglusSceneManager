A DLL Library tool to allow you write your own string editor of the SiglusEngine Scripts in C#
Tested with: Hanasaki Work Spring!
If You like, give-me a star plz~~


####Detection of the key of Siglus automatic - Unstable function
I tried to write a function to recognize the algorithm that loads on the memory the password of the engine, tried in 2 games, both recent, they worked. 
Some games didn't work because they have a more complex algorithm so my program wasn't effective, noting the time difference 
between the games of 2014/2016 and 2011/2012, I will suppose that the recent versions of Siglus have an algorithm that my program supports, so I won't 
bother to add full compatibility.
SiglusEngine has a dynamic algorithym, feel lucky if it recognize your game's algorithym. For now, 3 kinds are supported

Notes:

-use the ProcessDump to better results

-Do not rename the files generated by the ProcessDump

-Tested with Angle Beats, Hanasaki Work Spring!, Rewrite.
